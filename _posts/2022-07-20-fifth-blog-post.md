What your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
- I think R is very useful and creates lots of amazing output, especially the shiny app we are learning now. I also like how we can use GitHub to cooperate with others with R projects. So I will continue to use R going forward, but sometimes it takes a long time running bootstrap or processing big data, which is one thing I have concerns about. I think I will be switching back and forth between R and SAS in future.

What things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
- There are many things I'm going to do differently; for example, I will definitely use more tidyverse to manipulate data for it is such a useful package and I like how neat the code looks by using pipes. I will also use what I learned for data visualization in practice to make the plots and tables look nicer. In this course, I start to pay attention to Good Programming Practices when coding, which makes my codes in general look much better than before, so I will keep this in mind for all of my future codings. 

what areas of statistics/data science are you thinking about exploring further?
- I think more machine learning and deep learning are something I want to explore more in the future. We've already covered a lot about machine learning in this course, but it still takes lots of learning and practice to be good at it. I know there are some similarities between traditional machine learning and deep learning in terms of data preparation and pre-processing, so I want to learn more about how different they are.
