## Experience

I used R and SAS a lot, and I used Minitab for a couple of months when I
first started learning statistics. I like R because it has better
graphics, and markdown is really nice when outut pdf or html. I think R
is also more flexible compared to sas. I couldnâ€™t think of any parts I
miss about sas, maybe the processing time when dealing with large data.
I think R is a little bit easier to start with, but you have to work
very hard to be good at it. When first learning it, I was confused by
the packages and libraries. Sometimes installation is painful, I have to
spend a long time googling to figure out what happened. a

## Example R Markdown output

plot(iris)
