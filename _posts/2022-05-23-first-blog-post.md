What do you think being a data scientist is about? 

- I think being a data scientist is about uncovering insights from data through algorithms and models and using techniques like machine learning to improve the quality of data. 

What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? 

- I think the major duties are to be able to handle data, including cleansing, preparation, modeling, and analysis, which requires having strong knowledge of machine learning and statistics knowledge. Programming skill is also a major duty for a data scientist. You have to know how to apply the functions and models to conduct an analysis.

What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? 

- The similarities are they both gather information from data and extract knowledge from it. But I think statisticians are more theoretical and mathematically based, whereas data scientists, as a multidisciplinary field, are more applied, and applying requires a solid understanding of the theories. 

How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

- I think I’m transiting from statistician to data scientist after I get more practice in applying what I’ve learned from all the stats courses.
