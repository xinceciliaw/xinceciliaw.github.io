## Coolest thing about programming in R

I think the coolest thing about R is to create fancy plots and tables. I recently learned how to use the "table 1" package and it is very neat and useful in creating summary statistics. In terms of plots, I can't wait to learn how to create interactive plots by shiny app. 

## Example of Table 1 

```{r}
library(table1)
table1(~ Sepal.Length + Sepal.Width + Petal.Length +Petal.Width | Species, data = iris)
```
